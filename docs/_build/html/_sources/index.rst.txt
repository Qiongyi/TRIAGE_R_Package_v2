.. TRIAGE R Package documentation master file

Welcome to TRIAGE R Package (v2) Documentation!
===============================================

The TRIAGE R package (v2) provides a flexible, modular toolkit for identifying and prioritizing regulatory genes and genomic elements across diverse biological datasets.

This version supports:

- Regulatory analysis of both **bulk and single-cell RNA-seq** datasets
- **Genome-wide interrogation** of putative regulatory elements at **single-base resolution**
- Multiple input types including **gene expression matrices**, **gene lists**, and **genomic loci**

TRIAGE enables the discovery of regulatory drivers of cell identity, differentiation, and disease. Its efficient implementation allows most analyses to complete in under **30 minutes**, depending on dataset size and computing resources.

This documentation provides step-by-step instructions for both **academic research and teaching** and **general** users to install and use the TRIAGE R package v2. If you have obtained `TRIAGE.Research_2.0.0.tar.gz` or `TRIAGE.General_2.0.0.tar.gz` via the UQ e-shop, youâ€™re in the right place.
